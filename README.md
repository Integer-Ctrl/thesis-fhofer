## Name
Transferring Relevance Judgments with Pairwise Preferences

## Description
This repository contains the materials for my bachelor thesis, which explores the transferability of relevance judgements from one dataset to another. The work is divided into two parts:

1. **Thesis Document**  
   The full written thesis, detailing the theoretical background, methodology, experiments, and findings.

2. **Source Code**  
   The implementation of the practical experiments conducted as part of the thesis. The source code includes scripts for transferring relevance judgements, evaluating the quality of the inferred judgements on the target dataset.
