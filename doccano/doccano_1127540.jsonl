{"label": [], "text": " What is Shebang and How to Use this Character Sequence in Linux - Make Tech Easier\nHome > Linux\nWhat is Shebang and How to Use this Character Sequence in Linux\nJohn Perkins\nApr 8, 2021\nOne of the best features of Linux is that you can easily create scripts that are designed to automate and simplify tasks.  This can help when processing large groups of files, like log files if you\u2019re a Systems Administrator or CSV and TXT files if you\u2019re doing some kind of research.  However, there\u2019s one very specific set of characters that you have to understand to get scripting \u2013 the Shebang or #!.  We answer all your questions about the Shebang in this tutorial, a guide on how to use this character set in Linux.\n  What Is the Shebang?\nThe Shebang, or #!, is a character set used to direct your system on which interpreter to use.  If you\u2019re not familiar with what an interpreter is, it\u2019s basically the program that reads the commands you enter into the terminal on your Linux system.  You probably know it as Bash, but you also could use Fsh, Zsh, or Ksh.\n ", "query": "meaning of shebang", "query_id": "1127540", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0006-10-09672", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0006-10-09672___1", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0006-10-09672"}

The full path is usually /bin/bash or something like that.  Check out our guide on the Linux virtual directory structure if you\u2019re confused what that means.\n#!  is used in a text file of some kind to load the proper interpreter for the code that\u2019s below that file.  You could write out a script like what is shown in the following image.\n  And run it like what is shown in this image.\n  That will work for you, but it may get annoying after a while.  A better way to do it might be like this image.\n  And then run it like this.\n  Why Was the Shebang Invented?\nWhile using the Shebang takes an extra step when creating the script, being able to use a ./ or \u201cdot-slash\u201d to run your scripts will make it easier down the road.  The script takes care of which interpreter to pass the commands to, meaning you don\u2019t have to remember.  This is great if you\u2019re scheduling it as a cron job or if you\u2019re executing scripts from within other scripts.\n ", "query": "meaning of shebang", "query_id": "1127540", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0006-10-09672", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0006-10-09672___2", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0006-10-09672"}
{"label": [], "text": "It makes the system more simple to administer because regardless of whether you want Bash, Zsh, or Python to interpret the contents of the files, having that as the first line of your script will make it drop-dead simple.\n How Do I Use the Shebang?\nIt\u2019s very simple: just type it in the first line of your script file along with the absolute path to the interpreter you want to pass the commands to.  Here\u2019s a couple of examples:\n#!/bin/bash #!/bin/zsh #!/usr/bin/env python3\nOnce that\u2019s in the file, start typing below it.  Once you\u2019re done, save your file and make it executable by running one of the following commands:\nchmod 755 SCRIPT-NAME chmod a+x SCRIPT-NAME\n  They will both accomplish the same thing.  From there, all you have to do is run your script like this:\n./SCRIPT_NAME\nAnd you\u2019re done!

{"label": [], "text": "In a 1869 letter to his publishers, for example, Mark Twain writes, \"I like the book, I like you and your style and your business vim, and believe the chebang will be a success.\" It has been conjectured that this use is a generalizing of shebang, taking the idea of a building or vehicle and its contents as a whole entity and extending it to the entirety of other things.  Whatever the case, shebang took on an additional meaning leading to the familiar phrase \"the whole shebang.\"\nGiven that the Irish term shebeen was being used about a century prior to shebang, it is tempting to consider shebang as developing from shebeen.  It would, after all, give some insight into the the word\u2019s \"building\" and \"tavern\" meanings.

Considering these similar applications, one might think that the story of shebang is a straightforward one concerning a word originating as a name for types of small buildings or dwellings.  However, another early use of shebang was for a vehicle, which makes one wonder about the exact origin of the word and how its two very different senses came about almost simultaneously.  Mark Twain used shebang for a vehicle in his novel Roughing It.\n  You're welcome to ride here as long as you please, but this shebang's chartered.\n\u2015 Mark Twain, Roughing It, 1872\nSome etymologists surmise that the application of the word for a type of building may have been influenced by an Irish or French word.
