Sophisticated thieves, shady buyers, orchestrated burglaries, and the mysterious intrigues of the underworld keep captivating people's imagination.  Stealing art isn't a new thing.  According to the Guardian, the first recorded art crime was carried out in 1473 by Polish pirates who kidnapped a triptych from a church in Florence and took it to the city of Gdansk, where it still is today.\n  Yet for some reason there are legendary artworks that have been stolen several times.  \"But when it is notoriously difficult to sell on well-known works even on the black market, who would risk repeatedly targeting such paintings and why?\" asks journalist Riah Pryor at the Art Newspaper.  The reasons seem to be different.  Some thieves do it for the prestige, others act on commission, others for political purposes.  According to the Daily Mail, sometimes the art is \"exchanged for drugs or guns.\"  But there just seems to be something about certain paintings.  Let's take a look at the crazy stories of these infamous artworks that have been stolen more than once.\n ", "query": "art, stolen, forged", "query_id": "422", "query_narrative": "Instances of stolen or forged art in any media are relevant. \nStolen mass-produced things, even though they might be \ndecorative, are not relevant (unless they are mass-\nproduced art reproductions).

Do you know the appropriate steps regarding how to make a stolen car legal?  Statistics entail that vehicle theft increases, which is the more reason you should be aware of the act.  As unbelievable as it may seem, it is possible to legalize a stolen car.\n  To make stolen car legal, you would have to change the VIN number of the vehicle, forge ownership papers, get a duplicate car title, then legalize the car by rebuilding from scratch with the car parts available.  This is a long stressful process, but worth it if you are hell-bent on legalizing a stolen car.\n  People get away with stealing vehicles, especially if they have a well-phased planned to get the car off the heat of the moment.  The hardest aspect, for thieves, is to steal a car.  Once stolen, the legalization of the stolen car becomes a walkover.\n ", "query": "art, stolen, forged", "query_id": "422", "query_narrative": "Instances of stolen or forged art in any media are relevant. \nStolen mass-produced things, even though they might be \ndecorative, are not relevant (unless they are mass-\nproduced art reproductions).

However, they have no option than to forge.\n  They will not title the stolen car in the same city.  The stolen car may be titled in another suburb or any area away from the former.

And a chance remark by Decker prompted Valfiero to admit he was the man who\u2019d planned the theft of the Mona Lisa.\n  His plan was an elaborate scheme to sell the painting, not once, but over and over, without ever letting go of the painting.\n  The key to his plan was a skilled forger who could capture \u201cevery little trick of the artist who had painted it, duplicating his brush strokes, matching colors so perfectly that copy and original were indistinguishable.\u201d  But Valfierno realized that replicating a painting wasn\u2019t the biggest challenge in selling forged art.  Many buyers were interested only in the value of the art; few could tell a Murillo from a Rembrandt.  The real challenge was explaining to buyers why the stolen painting they had just bought could still be seen in its gallery.  Valfierno got around this objection by assuring the buyer it was merely a copy.\n  Later, he developed a more convincing method to prove the forgeries he sold were \u2018authentic.\u2019  He would accompany a buyer to a public gallery and take him to a painting he proposed to steal.

A week later, Valfierno would bring the painting to the buyer, and there, on the back, was the buyer\u2019s original mark.\n  The trick, Valfierno told Decker, was to access the painting ahead of time, just long enough to slip a forged copy inside the picture frame so that it rested behind the original.  When the buyer arrived, he would mark the back of the forgery.  After the buyer left, Valfierno simply slipped the forgery out of the frame, leaving the original untouched, which the buyer believed was a copy.\n  This ploy proved so successful, Valfierno was tempted to think of an even more lucrative scheme.  Why not try to sell a truly legendary painting?  Why not the Mona Lisa?  And why not sell it more than once?\n  So Valfierno found six separate art collectors in America willing to pay millions for the stolen Mona Lisa.  Valfierno\u2019s forger then painted six Mona Lisa forgeries.  Early in 1911, the forgeries were brought through New York customs one at a time, to avoid attracting attention.

Rosenberg and Marinello are at the heart of the fight to end the continuing trade in Nazi-looted art and are currently embroiled in what has become the most infamous stolen art case in history.  Rosenberg is the granddaughter of Parisian art dealer Paul Rosenberg.  From 1911, at his gallery at 21 rue de la Bo\u00e9tie, Paul Rosenberg charmed wealthy French patrons into paying top dollar for the works of Delacroix, Rodin, C\u00e9zanne, Manet, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Lautrec, Modigliani, Braque, Matisse and best friend Pablo Picasso, who lived next door.  Forced to flee France by the Nazis, who stole the bulk of the Jewish art dealer's world-class collection (400 works), Rosenberg moved to New York.  He spent the rest of his life \u2013 as did thousands of other Jewish families \u2013 hunting for his treasures, originally bought for hundreds of dollars, today worth many millions.\n ", "query": "art, stolen, forged", "query_id": "422", "query_narrative": "Instances of stolen or forged art in any media are relevant. \nStolen mass-produced things, even though they might be \ndecorative, are not relevant (unless they are mass-\nproduced art reproductions).

{"label": [], "text": "In addition to the necessity of good cyber security, much can be learnt from how the traditional art market is regulated.\n One solution that has been suggested is the development of a registry of stolen or fraudulently purchased NFTs.  This would mimic the Art Loss Register, which in the real world lists stolen art and prevents its resale in legitimate auction houses.  Some of the larger online auction houses for NFTs have already developed sections within their platform for tokens in which the claimed creator is verified.\n  With the development of guidance for KYC best practices, strong cyber security measures and a stolen art registry, many of the money-laundering risks of NFTs can be mitigated without restricting the growth of this new market.  Implementation of these techniques will ensure that consumers can trade freely within the market without the fear of purchasing a forged NFT or having a token stolen.\n  The views expressed in this Commentary are the authors\u2019, and do not represent those of RUSI or any other institution.\n  Have an idea for a Commentary you\u2019d like to write for us?

Similarly to physical art, there are opportunities to forge NFTs.  In March 2021, a hacker created a piece of digital artwork and put it up for sale on an online marketplace claiming it was a limited edition Banksy print.  To add authenticity, the creator hacked into the official Banksy website and posted a link to the NFT.  The token sold for roughly \u00a3244,000.  In a final twist however, the funds were returned by the hacker following the sale.\n  An art heist is also possible within the NFT realm.  Criminal actors can hack into user accounts on NFT marketplaces and transfer NFTs to their own accounts.  After transferring the NFTs, the hacker can quickly sell the stolen token(s) and attempt to launder the proceeds.\n  The digital aspect of these tokens also provides room for other novel risks.

An NFT is a unique digital token which is used to represent an asset, usually digital artwork, a piece of music or an item in a computer game.  The NFT can be held by its owner, traded, and sold for cryptocurrency or even real-world fiat currency, as occurred when the world\u2019s most expensive NFT artwork was sold for $69 million in March 2021.\nNFTs, especially for digital art, have come into existence for a number of reasons.  First, they provide an unchangeable record of ownership for any item represented in a digital format.  This concept is important because as more of the world moves online, individuals will increasingly want to \u2018own\u2019 assets in their digital environment.
