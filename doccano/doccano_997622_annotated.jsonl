It was quite the opposite, actually, as she credited the show for allowing her to spread her creative wings and fly off to other projects.\n  \"This kind of stability, this family, has nurtured me and made feel safe enough to stretch and grow creatively,\" she wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  \"The way [  executive producer and showrunner] John Wells has shepherded me as an actress, and more recently how he's encouraged me wholeheartedly as a director and a writer, has been an honor and a privilege.\"\nThe Gallagher home is actually in Chicago\nLokaGraph\n  Although much of the filming for \"Shameless\" took place in Los Angeles, the cast flew out to Chicago for two weeks per season for outdoor shots.  And the Gallagher house isn't just a set on some backlot in Hollywood — it's really in Chicago.  Cast members even got to know the real residents of the house and the neighborhood.  As Rossum told the Chicago Tribune, \"Oh my God, the little boy who lives in the Gallagher house — the real house — his name is DJ and he's eight years old now, so I've known him since he was one.  And I know DJ.

{"id":74716,"text":"The reality is that these people aren't 'the other,' they're people who live four blocks down from you and two blocks over.\"\nAnd, arguably, it's a good thing that Wells put his foot down when it came to the show's setting. With many scenic shots, and the real Gallagher house being in a Chicago suburb, the city became something of a character in itself.\n  Shameless was a reunion for Emmy Rossum and Justin Chatwin\nAmanda Edwards\/Getty Images\n\"Shameless\" represented an unlikely reunion for two of its stars.  Two years prior to the show's premiere, Emmy Rossum and Justin Chatwin starred in the 2009 live-action film \"Dragonball\" Evolution\" as Bulma and Goku, respectively.   Despite poor reviews, Chatwin was nonetheless thrilled about taking on such a beloved anime character.   \"I love playing the character of Goku because he's such a positive guy,\" he told Cinema.com .   \"He symbolizes moral good, positivity and hope –- but he's also just a regular kid.\"\nUnfortunately, it seemed like that reunion would be relatively short-lived, as \"Shameless\" fans were shocked at the (alleged) death of Chatwin's character at the end of Season 3.

{"id":74717,"text":"Let's dive in and learn the untold truth of \"Shameless.\"\nThe show was an adaptation of a U.K. series\nChannel 4\nMuch like \"The Office,\" which originally debuted in England before being adapted for American audiences, \"Shameless\" started out as a show in the U.K. The original version also follows the Gallagher family, but David Threlfall plays the father, Frank, and Anne-Marie Duff takes the role of eldest daughter Fiona. Other guest appearances included Hollywood heavyweight James McAvoy.  And instead of Chicago, Illinois, the U.K. version takes place in the fictional Chatsworth Estate, a community of Stretford, Greater Manchester.  Similar to the American version, the U.K. iteration ran for 11 seasons spanning from 2004 to 2013.\n  But wait, there's more.  Not only are there the U.K. and the U.S. versions of \"Shameless\", but the show has also been adapted for Russian and Turkish audiences, too, with those versions both premiering in 2017.

I previous saw her in Genius.    However, after watching the scene in Shameless where she was being processed in county jail.    I was amazed that she did it in one take and when she broke down crying it felt so surreal.    Later I read she had a panic attacked and Shameless director filmed it in the scene.    Emmy is a special person who has multiple talents and is down to earth.

The show aired on Channel 4 from 2004 to 2013 and is currently streaming for free on Tubi and Pluto TV.\n  The series has the same basic premise as the American version of Shameless, following Frank Gallagher and his gaggle of kids.  The series stars Anne-Marie Duff, David Threlfall, Annabelle Apison, and more folks.  In the UK series, the Gallaghers live at the fictional Chatsworth Estate, a deprived council estate in Stretford, Greater Manchester.\n  Where is Shameless available to stream?

{"id":74725,"text":" Is 'Shameless' Based on a True Story?\nIs ‘Shameless’ Based on a True Story?\nBy Fletcher Peters @ fIetcherpeters Nov 9, 2021 at 5:42pm\nIt’s hard to believe that one of Showtime ‘s most popular series, Shameless, has come to an end.  What a ride it’s been!  After 11 seasons of madness and more with Frank (William H. Macy) and the rest of the Gallagher family, the series wrapped around seven months ago.  If you’re wondering about the truth behind the whole show, there’s a bit of backstory — and we have all the details.\n  Centering in on complex themes like alcoholism, parenting, and family, Shameless really could be based on a lot of different things.  The show is incredibly realistic, with performances that have earned the show four Emmys.  Alongside Macy, the series stars folks like Emmy Rossum, Justin Chatwin, Ethan Cutkosky, and Shanola Hampton.\n  But what were they basing their performances on?  Here’s what you need to know about the story (true or not) behind Shameless.\n  Is Shameless based on a true story?\nNope, it’s not.  The Gallagher family isn’t a real family — well, the one in the show at least. ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0031-15-12188","query":"where is the show shameless filmed","query_id":"997622","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0031-15-12188___1","document_id":"clueweb22-en0031-15-12188","query_narrative":"","query_description":"","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":74726,"text":"A vocal section of viewers already considered this a natural conclusion because the show was so entwined with the life of Fiona.\n 12 Ending It Allows The Cast To Move On\nShameless has quite a large cast that includes big names such as William H. Macy, Jeremy Allen White, and Shanola Hampton.  Filming television series that often have more than a dozen episodes per season means that they lose out on being able to take part in other projects.  The end of Shameless means they can go onto new things.\n  11 The Show Can’t Go On Forever\nNo show should ever go on too long.  With a few exceptions, like soap operas, television shows have a limited shelf life.  Shameless has done very well making it to eleven seasons.  The show was always going to have to conclude at some point and it might as well be when the cast and crew decide rather than it being canceled.\n10 The Characters Have Changed So Much They Are Almost Unrecognizable\nA familiar complaint from many fans is that the last few seasons have seen characters change dramatically.  Viewers have argued that some of the main cast are now unrecognizable compared to earlier in the series.  While some evolution is to be expected for characters, their personalities and behavior have altered dramatically.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0037-13-08467","query":"where is the show shameless filmed","query_id":"997622","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0037-13-08467___3","document_id":"clueweb22-en0037-13-08467","query_narrative":"","query_description":"","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":74727,"text":"The way the show has been written means that it is difficult to have an interest in the likes of Xan or Jason. There is just no reason to invest in such characters because their storylines are neither exciting or dramatic.\n2 It Makes Sense Because The UK Version Also Ran For 11 Seasons\nCoincidentally, the UK version of Shameless on which the US show is based also ran for 11 seasons.  It ended in 2013 after 139 episodes in total, a remarkably similar amount to the US edition.  Having both shows end at similar points makes sense and is satisfying, demonstrating that it is perhaps the best time to conclude the show.\n1 Most Fans Feel The Time Is Right\nA majority of fans seem to think that the time is right for Shameless to end.  With the departure of important characters and the length of time it has been running on Showtime, ending after the eleventh season feels like a good and natural point to reach a conclusion.\n  Next: 15 Pics From Behind The Scenes Of Shameless That Change Everything\nWill Smith's Career Continues To Fall Apart After The Oscar Slap\nRead Next\nAbout The Author\nNathan Gibson (149 Articles Published) More\n                    From Nathan Gibson ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0037-13-08467","query":"where is the show shameless filmed","query_id":"997622","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0037-13-08467___6","document_id":"clueweb22-en0037-13-08467","query_narrative":"","query_description":"","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":74728,"text":"As well as some benefits for viewers, cast, and crew, it also means that the Shameless won’t abruptly get canceled.\n15 It Frees Up Budget That Can Be Better Spent Elsewhere\nOne of the biggest effects that the end of Shameless will have is that it will free up the budget for Showtime. Stars such as William H. Macy can earn up to $350,000 an episode, with episodes costing millions of dollars when you consider the whole cast and crew.  The network will be able to spend that money on creating new shows.\n  14 Gives Showtime More Space To Create New Original Content\nAnother benefit of Shameless coming to an end for Showtime is that it also frees up space.  Networks only have so much airtime and if it is already filled, it leaves no room for fresh content.  The end of this long running show will allow Showtime to switch up their schedule and give different series a chance at the success Shameless had.\n13 Emmy Rossum’s Departure Was Basically The End Of The Show Anyway\nFor man fans of the show, the most important character was Emmy Rossum’s Fiona.  She announced that she would be departing the series in 2018 and therefore missed the tenth season.

{"id":74732,"text":"When the cast was gathered to shoot some promotional photos for the start of Season 5, the actors didn’t just suffer through the activity. Instead, they made sure to make the most of their day and even got a bit “cheeky” when they mooned some patrons at a restaurant.  Even Emmy Rossum got in on the fun when her character, Fiona Gallagher, let her feelings known to the locals.  However, this isn’t an isolated incident for the cast.  William H. Macy, the actor that plays Frank Gallagher, stated that the cast always has a great time during promo shoots.\n  14 Patsy’s Pies Is A Real Location\nOne of the best parts of a series being filmed on location is the way that environment can become part of the show.  Shameless is filmed in Los Angeles and Chicago, so it can be a bit tricky trying to mix the locations in order to make it covey the same storyline.  However, it is still much better than doing all the scenes on a soundstage and having sets constructed for the entirety of the show.  Just as Sex and the City let the New York City setting become part of the series, Chicagoans have loved seeing one of its local restaurants used as a backdrop in Shameless.

{"id":74733,"text":"Fans of the series have tried to visit the Gallagher home while driving around Chicago but they’ve been surprised to see that the show doesn’t accurately depict the real home. In actuality, the house is in a much sketchier part of Chicago than depicted in the series and the interior shots of the home are filmed in Los Angeles.\n  9 Hand Me Down Pool\nEmmy Rossum is an actress that isn’t exactly known for having a multitude of nude and sex scenes throughout her acting career.  In fact, many of her character portrayals have actually been quite tame.  Yet, during the premiere season of Shameless, Rossum’s character partook in a skinny dipping scene that had viewers' tongues wagging.  On closer inspection, the pool that Fiona visited during her topless scene may have looked a little familiar.  The scene was filmed in the same pool that Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe visited in the 1999 film, Cruel Intentions.  The actual pool is at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles and must be a favorite for films that are looking to get a little risqué in a beautiful indoor pool setting.\n8 Handing Over The Reigns\nWhen it comes to television shows versus films, fans might be surprised to know that it’s not always the same director that shoots every episode.

{"id":74734,"text":"However, one thing about filming in Chicago is the fact that the weather won’t always cooperate with whatever needs to be done. A prime example is when Shanola Hampton, the actress that plays Veronica Fisher, gave an interview with The New Potato in 2015 and was asked what the craziest thing that ever happened on the Shameless set.  Her response was, “We were caught in a major blizzard!  It was like Armageddon!  We shut down production and one of my cast mates snow surfed while holding onto the back of a truck!  No board – just with his boots on.”\n2 Secrets To A “Real” Sex Scene\nThere have been a lot of secrets told over the years on how an actor can maintain his modesty when filming a nude scene.  In fact, the Game of Thrones’ actor, Jason Momoa, made headlines when it was revealed that he wore a bright pink sock over his manhood during a sex scene with Emilia Clarke.  Perhaps he did it to lighten the mood since he was essentially raping Clarke’s character in the episode.  Whatever the case, actors often have to wear some sort of sock apparel item to maintain their modesty onscreen.  Yet, there isn’t much said about what an actress wears in order to maintain modesty.

The show’s final season, filmed & set during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now available on Netflix.  The series finale provided closure for the characters & fans of the series.  Yet there’s someone who’s notably not included.\n  Emmy Rossum left her role as Fiona Gallagher on Shameless after season nine.  Fiona is given a fond farewell in being written off the show.  The selfless member of the Gallagher family finally gets a chance to take care of herself.  Rossum attributed her departure to a desire to pursue other creative avenues.\n  It seemed as if Emmy Rossum left Shameless on good terms.  However, her relationship with cast-mates might not have been as amiable as some would like to think.\n  Emma Kenney tells all\nIn a recent interview with Spotify’s Call Her Daddy podcast, Rossum’s co-star Emma Kenney spilled the beans of what occurred on the Shameless set.  Kenney played Debbie Gallagher, Rossum’s on-screen sibling.

While Emmy Rossum may be interested in acting more on film, she’s only had one movie credit since Shameless.  In the 2019 Liam Neeson thriller Cold Pursuit, she plays a detective in a small Colorado town.\n  With Emmy Rossum already having a commanding presence in television, perhaps she desires to work in different roles.  In 2019 she appeared in an episode of the USA Network series Mr. Robot, yet was uncredited.  However, Emmy Rossum may be pivoting away from acting in general.\n  Emmy Rossum the director & producer\nYou may be surprised to learn that Emmy Rossum has already directed a few episodes of television series.  In 2017 she directed an episode of the TNT show Animal Kingdom entitled “Broken Boards”.  Additionally, she directed an episode of the Amazon Prime original series Modern Love called “So He Looked Like Dad.  It Was Just Dinner, Right?” in 2019.\n  Rossum also seems as if she’s looking for more positions as a producer.

{"id":74744,"text":"According to Kenney, her relationship with Rossum was like that of family.\n In the interview, Kenney disclosed that Emmy Rossum was like a real sister “In good & bad ways.”  Kenney said that those who worked on Shameless “100% felt like a family.”  Yet every family has both positive & negative attributes.\n  Kenney said that when Shameless began, she & Emmy Rossum “Were both so young.”  Kenney admitted she was “Obviously a lot younger,” and Rossum would sometimes take advantage of this.  Kenney continued by saying “There were times where she would try to be a good influence, and then there were times where she would be blatantly giving me not the best advice.”\n  According to Kenney, it seemed as if Emmy Rossum was handling “Her own inner problems.”  Rossum’s toxic conduct on the set could have been “Her taking it out on other people,” Kenney thinks.  When Emmy Rossum exited Shameless, Kenney recalls feeling that “The set became a little bit more of a positive place.”\nEmmy Rossum after Shameless\nDespite belonging to the fictional Gallagher family, Emmy Rossum & Emma Kenney are estranged at the moment.  However, Kenney still thinks fondly of Rossum & their time together on the Showtime series.

However, Harrelson decided that he did not think he would be able to play the role as well as David Threlfall, who plays him in the original version of the series.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0009-28-01143","query":"where is the show shameless filmed","query_id":"997622","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0009-28-01143___5","document_id":"clueweb22-en0009-28-01143","query_narrative":"","query_description":"","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}

It was initially filmed in the UK and later rebooted in the US.\n  Just as similar UK-US projects like the Office, Being Human, Queer as folk, the show depicts the real people in favor of the “fairytale” perfect family.  The show is about people, their emotions, mistakes, and sinful craving.\n  To my mind, it’s a refreshing approach with the thousands of boring and unrealistic shows around.  Here, you can actually relate to people and some of their decisions.  No matter how shameful they are.  Though, in this case, I’d say shameless!\n  What Is This Shameless Quiz?\n  This quiz is a trivia test to check how well you know the American version of the show.

The real house is located in the south side of Chicago and while you can visit the home, you can't go inside.  The house is also not just a setting, as an older gentleman lives there when they aren't filming.\n  There reportedly is a little donation bucket left on the porch for visitors to leave for the current owner.  Although it's tempting to go visit the house, it's important to remember that the residents of the neighbourhood live in a poverty stricken area and are really struggling the way the Gallaghers' do.\n  The crew goes around Chicago once or twice a month to film at various locations including the house.

But what happens behind the scenes?\nHere are the 15 Behind-The-Scenes Secrets From Shameless\n15 Jimmy's Head\nThere is a scene from the Season 3 finale in which Justin Chatwin's Jimmy is brutally attacked.   A prop head was used and the scene was filmed to give the audience the indisputable idea that the character was dead and gone.\n  However, this didn't sit quite right with the writers and although Shameless creator John Wells publicly stated that Chatwin's character was dead, they decided to scrap the scene altogether just in case they decided to bring the character back.  The main reason for this is that he still had loose ends to tie up with Fiona.\n  The writers eventually did bring his character back for a few episodes to properly wrap things up.   This send-off pleased both the actor and the fans alike - after all who wants to go out like that?\n14 Sharing The Pool\nIn the episode where Steve and Fiona get hot and heavy in the pool, the location might look familiar to some fans of the 1999 movie Cruel Intentions.

The fact that we don't usually notice proves how good these sets are.\n  In the case of Shameless, the show is shot in both L.A. and Chicago.  The exteriors are filmed in Chicago.  Since the series is set in Chicago, it's nice to know that at least some things are filmed there, but it's definitely mostly shot in L.A like most television shows are.\n8 Lip And Mandy Are Actually In Love\nJeremy Allen and Emma Greenwell play a couple on the show, Lip and Mandy, and as it turns out, they're actually dating.\n  The two of them seem super cute together, and there's a lot of online speculation about whether they're going to get engaged soon.\n  Of course it's really none of our business because we don't know these famous couples personally and they can do whatever they want.  But it makes sense that people would be so attached to the idea of a TV couple actually being super and madly in love in real life.

It's got a much graver level of poverty attached to it.  It's not blue collar; it's no collar.\"  This definitely makes sense to fans of the show who have seen every episode.

Another example would be THE CONNORS, which I don’t watch, but their made up town with real life troubles is based on Elgin, Illinois.\n  You would have to know Canaryville, the neighborhood the show is set.
