Caedmon replied: 'I do not know how to sing and for that reason I went out from this feast and went hither, because I did not know how to sing at all.'  The man replied: 'Nevertheless, you must sing.'  When Caedmon asked what he must sing, the man said: 'Sing to me of the first Creation.'\nNow, whether it was God, Himself, who spoke to Caedmon or an angel, the story does not say, but we can assume that Caedmon had a pure heart.

Debbie has over 28 years of teaching experience, teaching a variety of grades for courses like English, Reading, Music, and more.\n  Praising God for His creation of heaven and earth is the common theme in Caedmon's Hymn.  Explore his life, how he acquired his talent in music, and the theme he used in his hymns.  Updated: 09\/14\/2021\nWho Was Caedmon?\nCaedmon was a Celtic herdsman who lived around 687 A.D..  He used to listen to teachings in the Streonæshalch monastery, and then he would go home and write music to what he heard.  But for most of his life, he had no musical talent.\n  Bede, an English monk who lived from 672-735 A.D., translated Caedmon's hymn from Old English to Latin.  He also wrote about Caedmon in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People.

{"id":74790,"text":"Here is a translation of his account:\n'In this abbess's monastery was a certain brother particularly glorified and honoured with a divine gift, in that he fittingly was accustomed to make songs, which pertained to religion and virtue, so that whatever thus he learned of divine letters from scholars, those things he after a moderate space of time he brought forth, in poetic language adorned with the greatest sweetness and inspiration and well-made in the English language. And by his poem-songs the spirits of many men were kindled to distain of the world and to service of a heavenly life.'\nBede tells us that Caedmon 'fittingly was accustomed to make songs.'  In other words, he was a talented musician.  His songs were spiritual in nature and encouraged those who heard them to live holy lives.  Bede makes it clear, too, that Caedmon's musical talent was a miraculous gift from God.  Caedmon wasn't always so musically inclined.\n3:59\n38K views\nHow Caedmon Got His Talent\nCaedmon was elderly, and for a long while he didn't have any musical or poetic talent.  As the story goes, the monks would pass around a harp and people would take turns singing.  Caedmon was embarrassed, so he left early.

{"id":74812,"text":"After Olaf finishes his song, he hops off, followed by Harold and Erik. However, Sven and Ottar decide to follow after Lyle, being careful not to get too close to him.  Lyle then returns to the exact same monastery that the Vikings raided before, where Sven and Ottar witness Lyle sharing a bag of potholders and a bag of money that the other Vikings gave him with the lead monk (played by Pa Grape) and his group of pea monks.  The pea monks then thank Lyle in song for sharing with them.\n  This confuses Sven and Ottar very much, before they return home to wait for Lyle.  When Lyle returns home, Sven and Ottar confront him and tell him in a song that he should stop what he's doing and that Vikings rule the sea and never give things back.  Lyle then explains to them in a song that when he shares, he gets his share of friends.  After Lyle finishes singing, Sven and Ottar realize that Lyle's method may be a lot better than Olaf's method after all, before realizing that Lyle would be in big trouble if Olaf learned what he was really doing.  Because of this, Sven and Ottar vow to keep Lyle's secret safe – which, according to Archibald, is easier said than done.

The first theme, \"Inner Universe\" even takes the next step and features latin vocals from boy soprano Ben Del Maestro.\n  Appears frequently in Blood+, where the aria \"Diva\" is sung by Elin Carlson.\n  Kira Yamato's personal battle theme in Gundam Seed Destiny, \"Kira Just As He Pleases\" features the One-Woman Wail, in direct contrast to Shinn Asuka's theme, which has Ominous Latin Chanting.\n  \"Ake ni Somaru\" from Hell Girl features both a woman and a child, mixed with creepy trance music.  It did a damn good job of turning mundane, peaceful scenes (like a cityscape at sunset) into spooky panoramas.\n  The ending credits to Gunslinger Girl has One Woman Wailing in Italian, with a second voice occasionally speaking without tone during interludes.

She is lust turned to wisdom.  She is diva turned to soothsayer.  In her mid-seventies at the time of this recording, Lincoln is the embodiment of a life lived as a performer and lover and now a storyteller through song.  Abbey Sings Abbey finds the songstress revisiting a number of her own compositions from past albums.  And while she remains a pre-eminent jazz singer, here she has surrounded herself with an eclectic and organic small group that imbues these tracks with a soft country-blues meets klezmer sound that rubs elegantly against Lincoln 's burnished vocals.  This is a beautifully raw and intimate album full of lament and the faint perfume of romance.  As she sings on \"Should've Been,\" \"It's the sound of sorry\/Looking yonder with regret.

As the first season's theme song \"Monk Theme\" had won the same award the previous year, Monk became the first series to have two different theme songs win an Emmy for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music in consecutive years.  The song is not to be confused with the Harry Nilsson song of the same name from his 1975 album Duit on Mon Dei.

{"id":74829,"text":"Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead’s gentle vocals blend as they describe a heavenly, solemn escape (“Slow dive, you can’t touch me now”). It’s not so much a chest-puffing manifesto or theme song as it is a bittersweet, disorienting shoegaze tune that happens to self-namecheck one of the genre’s undisputed best groups.\n10.  N.W.A.: “Straight Outta Compton”\nThe title track from N.W.A.’s 1988 Straight Outta Compton embodies the bold, provocative nature of West Coast hip-hop, and it’s the kind of song that makes parents and the FCC clutch their pearls—and apparently it worked since N.W.A. were banned by many radio stations in the ’80s.  Ice Cube’s opening verse needs no introduction (“Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube \/ From the gang called N*  **** With Attitudes”), and it foreshadowed the album’s fiery next track “Fuck Tha Police” (“See, I don’t give a fuck, that’s the problem \/ I see a motherfuckin’ cop I don’t dodge him”).\n9.

Calls to change the world with rock ‘n’ roll are met with eye rolls—often rightly so—but Art Brut are in on the joke when they sing, “We’re gonna be the band that writes the song that makes Israel and Palestine get along \/ We’re gonna write a song as universal as happy birthday.”\nTags\nbest songs\nlyrics\nself-referential\nGET PASTE RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX\nThe best music, movies, TV, books, comedy and more.

{"id":74831,"text":"Queen Latifah: “Latifah’s Law”\nWhile Queen Latifah’s debut album is best known for “Ladies First,” her female empowerment anthem with Monie Love, “Latifah’s Law” felt like a more concise representation of Latifah and her arrival as a solo artist. With a backing of reggae beats and a strutting horn loop, “Latifah’s Law” is a celebration of individuality, independence, Afrocentrism and self-confidence.  She closes the track by laying down some ground rules: “Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine \/ Rule number one: don’t step across the line that I drew \/ Number two: don’t take credit for something that you didn’t do \/ Number three: check your heart, every man has a call \/ It’s time for me to go, but I’ll be back, y’all.”\n18.  Arctic Monkeys: “Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys”\nUpon release, Arctic Monkeys’ 2006 debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, became the fastest selling British debut album of all-time, despite band members who were hardly 20-years-old.

The Psalms reflect all of human experience: joy, suffering, fear, anger, praise, thanks, contrition, petition.  The monks sing the Psalms on behalf of themselves and the rest of the world, aware that they reflect the real condition of men throughout the world.  The Psalms are the cry of the People of Israel.  They were on the lips of Our Lord and his disciples and continue to be the “hymnbook of the Church” in an unbroken tradition.\n  Most readings of Holy Scripture during the office are very short segments (lectio brevis).  Traditionally they are the same for most days, with variations appearing on feast days.  In their brevity and their repetition, the readings lend themselves to a positive familiarity and even memorization.

{"id":74835,"text":"Beginning with the words, “O God, come to my assistance,” the Blessed Trinity is praised in the Glory Be and the joyful exclamation of praise, Alleluia, is sung, recalling that the Lord is truly risen. Alleluia is sung not only on Sundays but daily, with the exception of Lent when the joyful exclamation is suppressed; instead is sung, “Praise to you, O Lord, King of everlasting glory.”\nLauds continues with two Psalms and an Old Testament canticle between them, each with its own antiphon.  Then follows a short reading from Scripture and a responsory.  After that is sung a hymn, then a versicle and response before the climax of the hour, the Benedictus (Canticle of Zachary).  The Church is “Zachary,” and she sings of the world’s redemption.  After the Gospel canticle comes the Kyrie, the Our Father (which is given to the community by the abbot, as Christ did for his apostles), the oration of the day, the dismissal Let us bless the Lord and the versicles and responses praying for the faithful departed and asking God’s assistance for the whole monastic community, brothers present and absent.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0004-91-07948","query":"who sings monk theme song","query_id":"1051399","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0004-91-07948___6","document_id":"clueweb22-en0004-91-07948","query_narrative":"","query_description":"","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":74836,"text":"Vespers\nSung toward evening, Vespers is the second of the two “hinge” hours. It is a service of praise, but with a stronger accent on thanks for the day’s blessings.  Vespers is often related to the Eucharist because of its note of thanksgiving and its time of day.  In fact many of its psalms are Eucharistic, including those sung at the Lord’s Supper, the Hallel (Pss. 112-117), and the Gradual Psalms (119-133) sung by pilgrims making their way to the Temple in Jerusalem.  Four psalms, each with its antiphon, are sung.  Again the structure is that of Lauds.\n  As the climax of Lauds is the Benedictus, that of Vespers is the other great canticle of the first chapter of St. Luke’s Gospel, the Song of Mary, the Magnificat, the glorious song of praise and thanks offered by the Blessed Mother of God, the image of the Church, filled with God’s love and singing of his marvelous works.\n  Compline\nAfter Vespers and just before bedtime, Compline is prayed.  While Vespers praises God as one looks in gratitude at the day ending, Compline is the prayer of the person aware of his weakness and sin, seeking the peace that is rest and protection in God.

To believe in Christ when he is shrouded in darkness, to stick hard and fast by the Saviour when all men speak ill of him, and forsake him, — that proves true faith and love.

Many of you sing very heartily now; I wonder whether you would sing as loudly if there were a stake or two in Smithfield for all of you who dared to do it.  If you sang under pain and penalty, that would show your heart to be in your song.  We can all sing very nicely indeed when everybody else sings; it is the easiest thing in the world to open our mouth, and let the words come out; but when the devil puts his hand over our mouth, can we sing then?  Can you say, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him”?  That is hearty singing, that is real song that springs up in the night.\n  Again, the song we sing in the night will be lasting.
