The most common sign of Lyme Disease is the erythema migrans rash.  This is an expanding red lesion with central clearing or a ring around it.  Other symptoms include flu-like infection with nausea and vomiting.  Joint pain may start days to weeks after the rash appears.  Causes of Lyme Disease\nLyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through infected ticks.  The infection can be transmitted by other ticks as well, but researchers found that the deer tick and its relatives were the primary carriers of this disease.  The bacteria lodge in skin tissue and causes a localized infection.  If it spreads, it will cause more serious problems and symptoms such as arthritis.  In many cases, the bacteria remain in skin tissue with no symptoms until the later stages of Lyme disease.\n  Early Signs and Symptoms Of Lyme Disease\nIn the first stage, called early localized infection, people often feel tired and weak.

An infected tick can transmit the spirochete to the humans and animals it bites.  Untreated, the bacterium travels through the bloodstream, establishes itself in various body tissues, and can cause a number of symptoms, some of which are severe.  Often, an erythema migrans (EM) rash appears within 7-14 days at the site of a tick bite (click to see picture of a typical EM rash ).\n  LD manifests itself as a multisystem inflammatory disease that affects the skin in its early, localized stage, and spreads to the joints, nervous system and, to a lesser extent, other organ systems in its later, disseminated stages.  If diagnosed and treated early with antibiotics, LD is almost always readily cured.  Generally, LD in its later stages can also be treated effectively, but because the rate of disease progression and individual response to treatment varies from one patient to the next, some patients may have symptoms that linger for months or even years following treatment.

There are over 300,000 estimated new cases of Lyme disease in the United States each year.\n  The symptoms of Lyme disease depend on how long the infection has been present in the body.

Unlike other types of infectious diseases, Lyme disease cannot be transmitted between humans or animals.\n  Lyme disease can cause a wide range of symptoms targeting a number of different organs and systems in the body.  Classically, Lyme disease presents with an bullseye-shaped rash around the area of the tick bite known as erythema migrans although not every person gets one.

{"id":74695,"text":"Why Lyme Disease is a Health Risk in Canada ‚Äî Wherever You Live\nUntil recently, most Canadians believed that the risk of being bitten and infected by a tick was relatively low ‚Äì provided we stayed away from the known tick risk areas, we were safe.\n Thanks to the changing climate, areas of Canada that were previously uninhabitable for ticks have become much more subject to ticks.  No longer limited to secluded forest areas, Lyme disease-carrying ticks are now found in and around some of Canada‚Äôs largest cities.\n  The number of people affected by Lyme disease in Canada has quietly but steadily been growing since the early 2000s.  Despite the fact that Lyme disease is grossly under-reported, numbers have risen from 144 reported cases in 2009 to over 1,400 in 2017 (NCCID).  Ontario, in particular, has seen a marked rise in reported cases, with 987 of the 2017 total coming from the province, and 78 from Toronto itself.\n  Public Health Ontario advises that people are mindful of ticks in all forested areas.  It is possible, though unlikely, that blacklegged ticks can be found anywhere that their habitat is supported.
