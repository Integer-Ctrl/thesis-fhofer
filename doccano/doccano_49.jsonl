Body worn footage can be used to assist police departments after an incident to prevent recurrences and to correct suspect behavior.  Body worn footage allows for immediate review of behavior without having to go through potentially muddy testimony regarding an encounter.  Police agencies are able to concretely see when an encounter goes very right or very wrong and duplicate that footage to train away from troubling behavior and towards positive decision making.  This is often far cheaper and more effective than creating unrealistic training videos of staged situations, or lecturing police officers on correct behavior without real-life reference points.

These cameras, usually deployed at the chest level allow a police officer to video interactions with the public during potentially high-stress confrontations, many agencies require their use.

Police are often accused of planting evidence, using too much force, making up reasons for contact, or harassing citizens.  There is a substantial incentive for individual officers to lie about or cover up these instances of legitimate misconduct, just as there is incentive for those accused of a crime to derail the investigation.

{"label": [], "text": "Arrest\nThere was a reduction in the number of arrests after the implementation of BWCs. Officers wearing BWCs experienced a decrease of 16.1% in arrests, whereas officers not wearing cameras experienced only an 8.9% reduction.  Thus, the reduction in arrests by officers wearing BWCs was almost twice that of officers not wearing the cameras.  However, it is important to note that this change in arrest patterns did not reach statistical significance with the reported data, suggesting that the reduction could be attributed to chance.  Given the dominant sentiment in the police department that the use of body cameras would stop policing, one interpretation here is that non-significant differences may suggest that officers are performing their normal duties, including arrests.  Following the multiple imputation for missing monthly values, an independent-samples t -test was again conducted to compare arrests between BWC wearing officers and the control sample.  There was a significant difference in arrests for officers with BWCs (M=27, SD=4.9) and those without (M=31, SD=5.8) in the post evaluation period; t (42)=2.51, p=0.016.

Introduction\nThe unjustified police shooting recorded by a bystander that occurred in North Charleston, South Carolina in 2015 offers just one extreme example of a police-citizen interaction that has fueled civil unrest, particularly within disadvantaged communities, over the last several years (Ford, 2015 ).  The nature of this unrest is not unlike that which was experienced in the 1960s and 70s which led to the development and widespread use of Community- and Problem-oriented Policing to address persistent community problems.  However, the response to today's discontent has centered much more on the use of technology.  One example of this includes the use of police officer body-worn cameras (BWCs) which are designed to record the interactions between police and citizens with the intention of moderating police and ostensibly, also citizen behaviors.

Is it allowable for anyone to be shot by an officer if they are breaking the law?  Of course not.  That would mean you could be shot for jaywalking, speeding, or a parking ticket.\n  We must hold police officers to the same standards as civilians in regards to deadly law enforcement.  Allow a jury to decide what the outcome should be.\n4. Create a community oversight board that involves civilians and police administration.\n  When there is civilian oversight of law enforcement, there is typically fewer instances of police brutality that occur.  The goal with oversight isn\u2019t to \u201cwatch the watchers,\u201d but to keep lines of communication open between people and police so that each understands the other.  By building relationships, we create stronger communities.  A stronger community is much less likely to dissolve into instances of brutality.\n5. Limit the statutes that police officers must enforce on a daily basis.\n  We could also make changes to how laws are enforced in our country.

Names like Walter Scott, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, and many others have created calls to find meaningful solutions to police brutality.\n  Some may argue that police brutality is more of a perception from news media or personal bias toward law enforcement.  Others may argue that police brutality has always been part of the US system of justice.  Wherever you fall on this spectrum, there are solutions that can help to prevent some of the 350+ civilian deaths that occur across the US every year at the hands of law enforcement officials.\n  Here are some reasonable ideas that we could all potentially work to implement in the near future in an effort to reduce violence.\n1.  Wear body cameras that cannot be turned off at the personal discretion of the officer.\n  Video collection technologies allow for police officers to be held accountable for actions that could be deemed to be questionable.
