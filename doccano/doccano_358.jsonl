{"label": [], "text": "Epidemiological Studies of Crash Risk by BAC\nDespite state laws mandating a limit of 0.08% BAC in the United States, evidence shows that a substantial proportion of alcohol-related crashes and fatalities occur when drivers have BAC levels below 0.08%. In 2015 there were 10,265 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities (BAC \u22650.08) in the United States and 1,808 fatalities involved a driver with a BAC between 0.01% and 0.07% (NHTSA, 2015 ).  Because the presence of alcohol does not mean that crashes and related fatalities are necessarily attributable to alcohol consumption, in addition to reviewing the evidence from simulator studies (above), the committee also reviewed epidemiological studies that examined the risks of fatal crashes involving driver BACs below 0.08%.  The best epidemiological evidence of the relationships between driver BAC levels and the risk of a crash are case-control studies in which BAC levels in drivers involved in crashes (cases) are compared with BAC levels in drivers not involved in crashes (controls).  Case-control studies match controls with cases using drivers from the same geographic areas and ideally during the same day of the week and time of day.  Some studies also obtain controls from cars traveling on the same roadways in the same direction in which case fatalities occurred.

{"label": [], "text": "Two recent studies evaluating the effect of lowering the BAC limit in Canada showed similar reductions in alcohol-related crashes and fatalities. Blais et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness of Canadian 0.05% administrative BAC laws by using data from the Traffic Injury Research Foundation and Statistics Canada to determine how newly instituted alcohol and driving measures may have affected alcohol-related crashes over a 24-year period.  Blais and colleagues found that between 1987 and 2010, 0.05% administrative BAC laws were responsible for reducing the number of fatally injured drivers with BAC levels of 0.05% or higher by 4.1 percent (95 percent CI 0.8\u20137.5).  A 3.5 percent reduction (95 percent CI 0.10\u20136.9) was also estimated in the number of fatally injured drivers with BAC levels exceeding 0.08%, and a 4.9 percent reduction (95 percent CI 1.35\u20138.51) was estimated in the number of fatally injured drivers with BAC levels exceeding 0.15%.  Byrne et al. (2016) conducted a study in the province of Ontario to evaluate the deterrent effectiveness of new countermeasures, including lowering the BAC limit from 0.08% to 0.05%.  The researchers found that the implementation of roadside suspensions for drivers with BAC levels between 0.05% and 0.08% resulted in a 17 percent decrease in injuries and fatalities related to alcohol-related crashes.\n ", "query": "blood-alcohol fatalities", "query_id": "358", "query_narrative": "Relevant documents must contain information\non automobile accidents in which there was a \nfatality and the blood-alcohol level of the\ndriver of the vehicle must be identified.", "query_description": "What role does blood-alcohol level play in \nautomobile accident fatalities?", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0024-84-00840", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0024-84-00840___37", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0024-84-00840"}

Venlafaxine may inherently be relatively toxic.  Furthermore, if venlafaxine is presumed to be more toxic than SSRIs, it is also more likely to be denoted as the primary cause of death.  Prescribing practices may also be different for venlafaxine than for SSRIs, with venlafaxine prescribed to people already at a relatively high suicide risk [  26, 27 ].  This hypothesis is supported by the finding that psychotropic agents are often present in venlafaxine-related deaths [  10 ].  In addition to venlafaxine, the above rationale might apply to mirtazapine, another dual-action antidepressant [  28 ].

After someone dies, their organs and blood cells continue to live for awhile.  There are no cells in the fluid in your eye, so after you die everything in that fluid stays much more constant than in your plasma.  It gives the pathologist a fair idea of what the level of everything that crosses into your eye in the first place was at the moment of death.\n81 views\nView upvotes\nRelated Answer\nKristen Thoenebe\n, Former addict\nAnswered 6 months ago \u00b7 Author has 1.3K answers and 361.8K answer views\nWhat is the highest blood alcohol content?\nOriginally Answered: What is the highest blood alcohol level recorded?\nAs of October 3rd 2020 this is the highest BAC ever recorded:\n1.480% BAC \u2013 Unnamed Polish Man (Poland)After a car accident that caused severe injuries, a Polish man's BAC was measured at 1.480%.

That\u2019s because it\u2019s measured in fractions, where a BAC of 0.05 can be high enough to be considered legally impaired in some places.

According to the Mayo Clinic, a fatal dose of alcohol can be consumed before a person loses consciousness.\n  \u201cEven when you\u2019re unconscious, or you\u2019ve stopped drinking, alcohol continues to be released from your stomach and intestines into your bloodstream, and the level of alcohol in your body continues to rise,\u201d the Mayo Clinic writes.\n  Alcohol also takes longer to leave the body as it is processed by the liver, so consuming too much alcohol in a short period could lead to poisoning.  Severe complications can arise after alcohol poisoning occurs.  One of them is choking.  Because alcohol depresses the gag reflex, people who drink too much are at an increased risk of choking on their vomit after they pass out.\n  Accidentally inhaling vomit into the lungs can fatally interrupt breathing.
