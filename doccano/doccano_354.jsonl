For example, a company dealing with an emergency release of toxic substances into the air, such as that from the Union Carbide plant at Institute, West Virginia, in August 1985, will probably balance several competing factors in deciding what messages to give out (Coppock, 1987).  After the initial emergency response, when the overriding concern is what to do to contain and stop the release, almost every business person immediately wonders who will bring suit.  The common view among legal advisors is almost always to give out as little information as possible so as to avoid providing ammunition for use in court.  This is in almost direct conflict with what communications and community relations experts advise, which is to say everything that is known, as quickly as possible, in terms the layperson can easily understand.  Advice of company scientists and engineers usually falls somewhere between these two views.  They caution against attributing cause and effect before being reasonably certain about what happened.  The message that is finally sent out probably involves compromises between these three points of view.\n ", "query": "journalist risks", "query_id": "354", "query_narrative": "Any document identifying an instance where a journalist or \ncorrespondent has been killed, arrested or taken hostage in the \nperformance of his work is relevant.", "query_description": "Identify instances where a journalist has been put at risk (e.g.,\nkilled, arrested or taken hostage) in the performance of his work.", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0001-85-15138", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0001-85-15138___48", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0001-85-15138"}

But reporters expect access not only to public information specialists but also to experts and managers and what they know (Sandman et al., 1987a).  This is especially true in emergency situations.  The price of not providing that access may include suspicion, anger, and sometimes damaging coverage.  Despite the legal and technical constraints, it is important to consider meeting the needs of the news media.\n  Many journalists are proud of their ability to flesh out a story with the views of uninvolved experts, dissident insiders, and others whose perspective on an event is likely to be different from the official one (Sandman et al., 1987a).  Specialized reporters are proud of their contacts and investigative reporters of their skill at finding those who know and of persuading them to talk.  Trying to stop reporters from talking to people within an organization is sure to encourage them to investigate further.\n  Differences of opinion as to what should ideally be presented are likely to exist between risk communicators and journalists.

You are preparing for a media interview, and the journalist has sent through a list of questions.  These questions are your known knowns, and, given that you have the opportunity, it is easy to prepare and rehearse strong responses, no matter how thorny the questions may be.  However, you know that it\u2019s possible the journalist has prepared some additional questions.  These are your known unknowns.  You may be uncertain what the journalist will ask, but you can prepare a range of responses, anticipating any challenging or complicated questions.\n  The above example demonstrates that with the right preparation, the risks associated with known knowns and known unknowns can be easily mitigated.

{"label": [], "text": "Their biggest problems were in dedicating large amounts of staff time to unfamiliar problems; lacking resources to hire experts in strategic communication, they both conducted campaigns themselves and took valuable time away from distribution, promotion, research or production. But even so, makers also often reported a positive boost in publicity for their projects from the attacks.\n  So it seems that risks while real are also to some extent familiar ones to investigative journalism, and that most work is executed without encountering a bruising experience with litigation or smear campaigns.  But the interviewees also told us that many newer entrants into production, including veteran filmmakers with little investigative journalistic experience, lacked good ways to do risk assessment in several areas.  We also noted that it is easy to generalize anecdotes erroneously into a perception of industry trends, particularly around litigation.\n  The knowledge to do better risk assessment, to obtain tools (albeit clumsy) to manage security, and to develop production practices to minimize risk exists.  Some of it is available for free and online.  Some of it is available for hire, from programmers, lawyers and insurers.\n  RECOMMENDED PRACTICES\nTo mitigate the genuine risks that exist, what can makers do?  We discuss below some of the most commonly volunteered advice from our interviewees and literature search.\n ", "query": "journalist risks", "query_id": "354", "query_narrative": "Any document identifying an instance where a journalist or \ncorrespondent has been killed, arrested or taken hostage in the \nperformance of his work is relevant.", "query_description": "Identify instances where a journalist has been put at risk (e.g.,\nkilled, arrested or taken hostage) in the performance of his work.", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0005-58-02103", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0005-58-02103___47", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0005-58-02103"}
{"label": [], "text": "In some cases, though, subjects volunteer for the risk of exposure and may even believe that more exposure might provide more security or a solution. This was the case with Mexican reporters threatened by gangs in Reportero, and with subjects in Give Up Tomorrow, who hoped that the film might bring attention to an unjust verdict.\n  In other cases, such as of whistleblowers, preserving anonymity was of great importance.  In the case of 1971, about civil disobedience, the subjects expected to become public figures with the release of the journalism (both textual and filmic) about them.  But until that moment, guarding their privacy was centrally important.  The filmmakers also maintained anonymity of other sources in the film.  In dealing with female subjects who have suffered gender-based violence, bullying, or cyberbullying, Nancy Schwartzman is careful to have face-to-face, offline conversations with them, never to show their faces online, and never to use their names, unless given explicit consent.\n  However, makers also realize the limits of what they can promise to their subjects.  One pointed out that some situations are non-negotiable; when you are crossing a border, for instance, you are vulnerable to the demands of the border officials.

Non  -fiction filmmakers who tell truth to power often face aggressive attack from powerful individuals, governmental bodies, businesses and associations.  How are independent makers, often working outside of media institutions for long periods of time, and sometimes untrained in journalistic practices, working with this reality?  What are the risks, and can they be mitigated to encourage more and better expression on the important issues of the day?\n  This report finds that the risks of doing such work are well-established in the investigative journalism community, but not always well known in the documentary film community.
