And the Gallagher house isn't just a set on some backlot in Hollywood \u2014 it's really in Chicago.  Cast members even got to know the real residents of the house and the neighborhood.  As Rossum told the Chicago Tribune, \"Oh my God, the little boy who lives in the Gallagher house \u2014 the real house \u2014 his name is DJ and he's eight years old now, so I've known him since he was one.

With many scenic shots, and the real Gallagher house being in a Chicago suburb, the city became something of a character in itself.\n  Shameless was a reunion for Emmy Rossum and Justin Chatwin\nAmanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\"Shameless\" represented an unlikely reunion for two of its stars.  Two years prior to the show's premiere, Emmy Rossum and Justin Chatwin starred in the 2009 live-action film \"Dragonball\" Evolution\" as Bulma and Goku, respectively.\u00a0  Despite poor reviews, Chatwin was nonetheless thrilled about taking on such a beloved anime character.\u00a0  \"I love playing the character of Goku because he's such a positive guy,\" he told Cinema.com .\u00a0  \"He symbolizes moral good, positivity and hope \u2013- but he's also just a regular kid.\"\nUnfortunately, it seemed like that reunion would be relatively short-lived, as \"Shameless\" fans were shocked at the (alleged) death of Chatwin's character at the end of Season 3.

Other guest appearances included Hollywood heavyweight James McAvoy.  And instead of Chicago, Illinois, the U.K. version takes place in the fictional Chatsworth Estate, a community of Stretford, Greater Manchester.  Similar to the American version, the U.K. iteration ran for 11 seasons spanning from 2004 to 2013.\n  But wait, there's more.  Not only are there the U.K. and the U.S. versions of \"Shameless\", but the show has also been adapted for Russian and Turkish audiences, too, with those versions both premiering in 2017.

I was amazed that she did it in one take and when she broke down crying it felt so surreal.    Later I read she had a panic attacked and Shameless director filmed it in the scene.

Shameless was, however, based on something entirely different.\n  What is Shameless based on?\nShameless was based on a British TV series of the same name created by Paul Abbott that ran for, shockingly, 11 seasons as well.  The show aired on Channel 4 from 2004 to 2013 and is currently streaming for free on Tubi and Pluto TV.\n  The series has the same basic premise as the American version of Shameless, following Frank Gallagher and his gaggle of kids.  The series stars Anne-Marie Duff, David Threlfall, Annabelle Apison, and more folks.  In the UK series, the Gallaghers live at the fictional Chatsworth Estate, a deprived council estate in Stretford, Greater Manchester.\n  Where is Shameless available to stream?

{"label": [], "text": " Is 'Shameless' Based on a True Story?\nIs \u2018Shameless\u2019 Based on a True Story?\nBy Fletcher Peters @ fIetcherpeters Nov 9, 2021 at 5:42pm\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that one of Showtime \u2018s most popular series, Shameless, has come to an end.  What a ride it\u2019s been!  After 11 seasons of madness and more with Frank (William H. Macy) and the rest of the Gallagher family, the series wrapped around seven months ago.  If you\u2019re wondering about the truth behind the whole show, there\u2019s a bit of backstory \u2014 and we have all the details.\n  Centering in on complex themes like alcoholism, parenting, and family, Shameless really could be based on a lot of different things.  The show is incredibly realistic, with performances that have earned the show four Emmys.  Alongside Macy, the series stars folks like Emmy Rossum, Justin Chatwin, Ethan Cutkosky, and Shanola Hampton.\n  But what were they basing their performances on?  Here\u2019s what you need to know about the story (true or not) behind Shameless.\n  Is Shameless based on a true story?\nNope, it\u2019s not.  The Gallagher family isn\u2019t a real family \u2014 well, the one in the show at least.

{"label": [], "text": "A vocal section of viewers already considered this a natural conclusion because the show was so entwined with the life of Fiona.\n 12 Ending It Allows The Cast To Move On\nShameless has quite a large cast that includes big names such as William H. Macy, Jeremy Allen White, and Shanola Hampton.  Filming television series that often have more than a dozen episodes per season means that they lose out on being able to take part in other projects.  The end of Shameless means they can go onto new things.\n  11 The Show Can\u2019t Go On Forever\nNo show should ever go on too long.  With a few exceptions, like soap operas, television shows have a limited shelf life.  Shameless has done very well making it to eleven seasons.  The show was always going to have to conclude at some point and it might as well be when the cast and crew decide rather than it being canceled.\n10 The Characters Have Changed So Much They Are Almost Unrecognizable\nA familiar complaint from many fans is that the last few seasons have seen characters change dramatically.  Viewers have argued that some of the main cast are now unrecognizable compared to earlier in the series.  While some evolution is to be expected for characters, their personalities and behavior have altered dramatically.\n ", "query": "where is the show shameless filmed", "query_id": "997622", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0037-13-08467", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0037-13-08467___3", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0037-13-08467"}
{"label": [], "text": "The way the show has been written means that it is difficult to have an interest in the likes of Xan or Jason. There is just no reason to invest in such characters because their storylines are\u00a0neither exciting or dramatic.\n2 It Makes Sense Because The UK Version Also Ran For 11 Seasons\nCoincidentally, the UK version of Shameless on which the US show is based also ran for 11 seasons.  It ended in 2013 after 139 episodes in total, a remarkably similar amount to the US edition.  Having both shows end at similar points makes sense and is satisfying, demonstrating that it is perhaps the best time to\u00a0conclude the show.\n1 Most Fans Feel The Time Is Right\nA majority of fans seem to think that the time is right for Shameless to end.  With the departure of important characters and the length of time it has been running on Showtime, ending after the eleventh season feels like a good and natural\u00a0point\u00a0to reach a conclusion.\n  Next: 15 Pics From Behind The Scenes Of Shameless That Change Everything\nWill Smith's Career Continues To Fall Apart After The Oscar Slap\nRead Next\nAbout The Author\nNathan Gibson (149 Articles Published) More\n                    From Nathan Gibson ", "query": "where is the show shameless filmed", "query_id": "997622", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0037-13-08467", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0037-13-08467___6", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0037-13-08467"}

Stars such as William H. Macy can earn up to $350,000 an episode, with episodes costing millions of dollars when you consider the whole cast and crew.  The network will be able to spend that money on creating new shows.\n  14 Gives Showtime More Space To Create New Original Content\nAnother benefit of Shameless coming to an end for Showtime is that it also frees up space.  Networks only have so much airtime and if it is already filled, it leaves no\u00a0room for fresh content.  The end of this long running show will allow Showtime to switch up their schedule and give different series a chance at the success Shameless had.\n13 Emmy Rossum\u2019s Departure Was Basically The End Of The Show Anyway\nFor man fans of the show, the most important character was Emmy Rossum\u2019s Fiona.

Shameless is filmed in Los Angeles and Chicago, so it can be a bit tricky trying to mix the locations in order to make it covey the same storyline.  However, it is still much better than doing all the scenes on a soundstage and having sets constructed for the entirety of the show.

In fact, many of her character portrayals have actually been quite tame.  Yet, during the premiere season of Shameless, Rossum\u2019s character partook in a skinny dipping scene that had viewers' tongues wagging.  On closer inspection, the pool that Fiona visited during her topless scene may have looked a little familiar.  The scene was filmed in the same pool that Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe visited in the 1999 film, Cruel Intentions.

The show\u2019s final season, filmed & set during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now available on Netflix.  The series finale provided closure for the characters & fans of the series.  Yet there\u2019s someone who\u2019s notably not included.\n  Emmy Rossum left her role as Fiona Gallagher on Shameless after season nine.  Fiona is given a fond farewell in being written off the show.  The selfless member of the Gallagher family finally gets a chance to take care of herself.  Rossum attributed her departure to a desire to pursue other creative avenues.\n  It seemed as if Emmy Rossum left Shameless on good terms.  However, her relationship with cast-mates might not have been as amiable as some would like to think.\n  Emma Kenney tells all\nIn a recent interview with Spotify\u2019s Call Her Daddy podcast, Rossum\u2019s co-star Emma Kenney spilled the beans of what occurred on the Shameless set.  Kenney played Debbie Gallagher, Rossum\u2019s on-screen sibling.

{"label": [], "text": "In the Call Her Daddy interview, Kenney claims \u201cI have a lot of love for her, and I hope that she finds her happiness.\u201d\nEven though Rossum claimed to be leaving Shameless work on other projects, she has only appeared in a few works since. While Emmy Rossum may be interested in acting more on film, she\u2019s only had one movie credit since Shameless.  In the 2019 Liam Neeson thriller Cold Pursuit, she plays a detective in a small Colorado town.\n  With Emmy Rossum already having a commanding presence in television, perhaps she desires to work in different roles.  In 2019 she appeared in an episode of the USA Network series Mr. Robot, yet was uncredited.  However, Emmy Rossum may be pivoting away from acting in general.\n  Emmy Rossum the director & producer\nYou may be surprised to learn that Emmy Rossum has already directed a few episodes of television series.  In 2017 she directed an episode of the TNT show Animal Kingdom entitled \u201cBroken Boards\u201d.

This only ended when Mandy hit Karen with her car in order to keep her away from Lip.  Mandy was obsessed with being the perfect girl for Lip.\n  However, Lip treated Mandy in the same horrible way that Karen treated him.  Unlike the show, however, Emma Greenwell and Jeremy Allen White, who portray Mandy and Lip, dated six years after meeting on the set of Shameless, in October 2011.\n  The couple seemed quite happy together and pretty much stayed out of the spotlight for most of their relationship - save for some Instagram posts on Greenwell's account.

The main reason\u00a0for this is that he still\u00a0had\u00a0loose ends to tie up with Fiona.\n  The writers eventually did bring his character back for a few episodes to properly wrap things up.\u00a0  This send-off pleased both the actor and the fans alike - after all who wants to go out like that?\n14 Sharing The Pool\nIn the episode where Steve and Fiona get hot and heavy in the pool, the location might look familiar to some fans of the 1999 movie Cruel Intentions.
