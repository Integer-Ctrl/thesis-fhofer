Of six cases of container losses in the North Pacific between November 2020 and March 2021 analyzed by AGCS (One Apus, Maersk Essen, Maersk Eindhoven, Ever Liberal, Tianping and MSC Aries) there were a number of common factors, according to Chopra.\n  \u201cAll container losses occurred in rough seas and when the vessels were on a westerly heading during the voyage from Asia to the US.\n  The loss of containers could be the result of a combination of various factors like synchronous and parametric rolling.  But there may also be other issues at play, such as container stack collapse due to mis-declaration of cargo weights at a time when freight rates have been increasing,\u201d says Chopra.\n  In 2018, the container ship CMA CGM G.

It is prone to risks that occur due to act of God, fire, enemies, etc.\n  Hull insurance: When the ship is prone to risks that arise out of an act of God, fire, enemies, etc. then the shipowner can take hull insurance, to cover these risks.\n  Freight insurance: Freight insurance is taken when the owner of goods commits to pay the freight charges if the cargo is delivered to the port in a safe manner, and it destroys on the way.

Even weather conditions influence whether a marine insurance policy will be covered or not.\n  A marine insurance policy also depends to a large extent on the size of the ship.  Another important thing to be considered while going for cargo insurance is whether to opt for an insurance policy that will be covered as per the voyages taken by the ship or as per a pre-defined time schedule decided by the ship owner.\n  Thus it can be concluded that taking out marine cargo insurance does not only depend on the client but also on other factors as well.

In the absence of marine insurance, ship owners could incur not just loss to their ships but could also face financial losses in case if the ship is commercially used as cargo-carriers.\n  This is why, in order to specifically ensure the protection of the cargo that is carried, there is the concept of cargo insurance or marine cargo insurance.  The difference between marine insurance and the marine cargo insurance can be explained below:\nMarine Insurance: Marine insurance policies are based on the Marine Insurance Act, 1906.  While marine insurance is deep in its coverage of possible losses, it does not cover losses that happen while the ship is sailing in the waters.  This becomes a problem in case of those water areas where the risk of loss is magnified because of piracy and other reasons.

{"label": [], "text": "This difference is mostly explained by a low number of collision accidents. This might be explained by the fact that fishing ships spent more time in less crowded fishing areas and less time in busy traffic lanes, where the probability of a collision is higher.\n  Fig.\u00a010 shows the number of ship losses due to navigation-related accidents.  The total number of ship losses due to navigation-related accidents between 2000 and 2018 is 513, which is only 30% of all ship losses.  This implies that navigation-related accidents are on average less severe than other casualty types in terms of damage to the ship.  As can be seen, the number of ship losses rapidly decreases for ships with a length above 120 m. This can at least in part be attributed to IMO's damage stability regulations.

{"label": [], "text": "For example:\nShip A collides with ship B and ship A is held 100 per cent to blame for the collision. Ship B suffers losses of USD 15 million which is less than the sum to which ship A can limit its liability.  Consequently, ship A is liable to pay ship B its full claim of USD\u00a015\u00a0million.  However, the hull and machinery (H&M) policy of ship A is subject to the Nordic Plan 2013 which includes standard 4/4ths collision liability cover with an insured value of USD 12 million.  Therefore, since the cover for collision liability under the H&M policy for ship A is limited to USD 12 million, i.e. the sum insured, ship A\u2019s liability to pay the balance of USD 3 million is not covered by the H&M policy with the result that cover for that balance is available under Rule 36.\n  The cover for collision liability is usually additional to the cover for loss of, or damage to, the insured ship.  Therefore, the hull insurers may be liable for double the sum insured if the insured ship becomes an actual or constructive total loss as a result of the collision and the liability of that ship to the other ship(s) equals or exceeds the sum insured.

{"label": [], "text": "6 If the vessel is bareboat or demise chartered, any liability is likely to rest with the bareboat (demise) charterer rather than the registered owner of the Ship, since the bareboat charterer is responsible for operation of the Ship, including navigation.\n 7 The Convention determines that each shipowner shall bear his own loss in circumstances where neither ship is considered to be at fault for the collision, e.g. two ships collide as a result of breaking their moorings or dragging their anchors following a sudden, unexpected and irresistible natural phenomenon such as a tsunami.  The same principle applies in circumstances where it is impossible to establish who is to blame, e.g. two ships colliding in open sea with the loss of all hands and with no other witnesses or information.\n8 Under US law the owners of both ships are also jointly and severally liable in respect of damage to property, including damage to cargo on each ship.  In order to avoid certain difficulties which arise in such circumstances the Association has recommended that, even though this clause is probably not enforceable in the US in relation to public contracts of carriage, the \u2018Both to Blame Collision Clause\u2019 is included in Bills of Lading and charterparties and a failure so to do may prejudice cover.
