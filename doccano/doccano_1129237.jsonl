A method has also been proposed for producing slush hydrogen from liquid hydrogen, using magnetic refrigeration to produce temperatures below 13.8 K (Waynert et al., 1989 ).\n3.4.2.  Slush hydrogen production\nVarious methods for slush hydrogen production have been implemented, most notably the freeze\u2013thaw method for the National Aero-Space Plane project in the United States.  The use of slush hydrogen with a solid fraction of 0.50 is expected to reduce the total takeoff weight of the space plane by 13\u201326% (DeWitt et al., 1990 ).\n  The major production methods are spray, freeze\u2013thaw, and auger.  In the spray method, a nozzle is used for the adiabatic expansion of liquid hydrogen to produce solid particles.  However, the particles formed in this manner tend to melt when mixed into liquid hydrogen, making this method unsuitable for the efficient mass production of slush.\n  Freeze\u2013thaw is a relatively straightforward method, the steps of which are described below, and is applicable at the experimental level or for small- to medium-scale production.\n ", "query": "hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature", "query_id": "1129237", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0034-22-03712", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0034-22-03712___12", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0034-22-03712"}

The solid hydrogen that forms at the heat transfer surface is scraped off by a rotating auger, forming fine particles of solid hydrogen.  Since the heat exchanger and auger are immersed in the liquid hydrogen, the solid hydrogen particles are mixed into the liquid during the production process.\n  If liquid hydrogen and cryogenic helium are continuously supplied, slush hydrogen can be continuously produced at a higher pressure than the triple-point pressure, making this method suitable for mass production.  By adjusting the gap between the auger and the heat transfer surface and/or changing the rotational speed of the auger, the size of the solid particles can be controlled.\n  Daney et al.

{"label": [], "text": "34].\n The primary concern for the storage of liquid hydrogen is the energy-intensive liquefaction process.  There are two main fundamental reasons as to why the liquefaction of hydrogen requires a substantial input of energy: the extremely low boiling point of hydrogen (\u2212253\u00a0\u00b0C at 1\u00a0bar) and the fact that hydrogen gas does not cool down during throttling processes (adiabatic, isenthalpic expansion) for temperatures above around \u221273\u00a0\u00b0C.  The latter problem necessitates precooling in the liquefaction process, most often by the evaporation of liquid nitrogen [  35].\n  Nevertheless, hydrogen liquefaction is reasonably well-established: the global installed hydrogen liquefaction capacity is around 355 tonnes per day (tpd); the largest plant currently in operation has a capacity of 34 tpd [36].  The all-time largest hydrogen liquefaction plants were constructed for NASA during the 1950s-1970s; most more recently constructed plants are small in comparison (1\u201310 tpd)  [  36].  The most modern hydrogen liquefaction plants have a specific energy demand of approximately 10 kWh el /kg, but it is thought that values approaching, or possibly even below, 6 kWh el /kg can be achieved in larger plants with various process improvements (minimum theoretical work for 25\u00a0bar feed is 2.7\u00a0kWh/kg)  [ ", "query": "hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature", "query_id": "1129237", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0008-39-13333", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0008-39-13333___12", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0008-39-13333"}

The borohydrides tend to bind hydrogen stronger than the alanates, an example is LiBH 4 for which the average dehydrogenation enthalpy is approximately 75\u00a0kJ/mol; hence, higher temperatures are needed to release hydrogen, generally above 300\u00a0\u00b0C  [  95].

Hydrogen liquefaction is considered an established technology, although several improvements are being carried out, specifically further reducing energy consumption.  The current global production of liquid hydrogen is approximately 355 t/d, with the largest liquefaction plant producing up to 34 t/d [64 ].\n  Hydrogen has been initially liquefied in 1898 by Sir James Dewar in Scotland using a small liquefaction device with a capacity of 0.24 L/h  [  65 ], several years before a pre-cooled Hampson\u2013Linde cycle was tested in a laboratory-scale liquefaction system  [  64 ].  Dewar initially pressurized gaseous hydrogen to 18 MPa, and then pre-cooled using carbolic acid and liquid air to a temperature of \u2212250 \u00b0C.  This liquefaction system is relatively similar to the Hampson\u2013Linde cycle, which is currently adopted for air liquefaction [  64 ].  Several other liquefaction processes were developed around 1900, including Claude, pre-cooled Claude, and helium-refrigerated systems.

The produced hydrogen is then liquefied before being loaded for transportation.  Various transportation options are available, such as sea tankers, trucks, and railway tankers.  Transportation covers long-distance international shipping and domestic distribution.  In the utilization sites, liquid hydrogen is unloaded and regasified before being distributed to small sale consumers.\n  Figure 1.  Basic liquid hydrogen supply chain, covering hydrogen production, liquefaction, transportation, storage, transportation, and utilization.\n  However, hydrogen liquefaction is an energy-intensive process.  In addition, because of the extremely low temperature of \u2212253 \u00b0C, handling and transporting liquid hydrogen requires advanced technologies and careful handling to minimize hydrogen loss and hazardous risks.  Several technologies for liquefying gaseous hydrogen have been developed, including storage and transportation.  This paper reviews the characteristics of liquid hydrogen, liquefaction technology, storage and transportation, and some safety aspects and standards required to manage liquid hydrogen.\n2.

Characteristics of Liquid Hydrogen\nLike gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen is odorless, tasteless, and colorless.  The main characteristics of liquid hydrogen distinguishing it from gaseous hydrogen are its very low temperature and liquid phase.  The liquid phase leads to a significantly higher density (approximately 848 times that of gaseous hydrogen).  The properties of liquid hydrogen are listed in Table 3.\n  Table 3.  Physical properties of liquid hydrogen.\n  Furthermore, discussion related to hydrogen isomers becomes very important when considering liquid hydrogen.  Hydrogen has two different spin isomers that possibly coexist; they are ortho- and para-hydrogen.  This phenomenon was initially observed in 1912 during experiments using hydrogen at low temperatures.  The heat capacity at cryogenic temperatures showed different hysteresis compared to the cooling and heating curves.  Subsequently, the existence of a hydrogen spin isomer was postulated [  57] and experimentally proven [  58] in 1927 and 1929, respectively.\n  Figure 4 shows the spin isomers of hydrogen and para-hydrogen concentrations in equilibrium hydrogen according to the temperature.  In addition, Table 4 shows the characteristic comparison of ortho- and para-hydrogen.

Oxygen is one of the most electronegative elements (the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons) so it typically exhibits a partial negative charge as it is more electronegative than the less electronegative element hydrogen it is bonded with, giving hydrogen a partial positive charge.  These opposite partial charges create strong hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom in one H2O molecule and the hydrogen atoms in another H2O molecule, on the other hand, sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, making the\nContinue Reading\nRelated Answer\nA Learner\nAnswered 4 years ago \u00b7 Author has 68 answers and 77.2K answer views\nWhy is H2O a liquid while HF is a gas at room temperature?\nIt would be worth specifying that hydrogen fluoride boils at about 20\u2218C, so if by room temperature you mean 25\u2218C, then hydrogen fluoride will actually be a gas.\n ", "query": "hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature", "query_id": "1129237", "query_narrative": "", "query_description": "", "document_id": "clueweb22-en0021-50-15759", "passage_id": "clueweb22-en0021-50-15759___8", "url": "https://chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0021-50-15759"}
