Wind power point forecasts are usually used as the estimation of location parameter μ. While for the scale parameter σ 2, several estimators have been proposed, e.g. non-linear time-series and artificial intelligence.  Without any assumption of distribution shape, in non-parametric approaches, predictive PDFs or CDFs are estimated at a finite number of points, as shown in Eqs.  (5), (6).  Then through the interpolation among these points, we can obtain the full description of predictive PDFs or CDFs.  Some non-parametric approaches have been applied in probabilistic forecasts, e.g. quantile regression and kernel density estimation.\n  Advantages of parametric approach are that the distribution shape only depends on a few parameters, resulting in the simplified estimation and low computational costs.  However, sometimes the assumption of wind power distribution shape may be not reasonable, and the shape of predictive density changes with time.  This phenomenon would influence the effectiveness of parametric approach.  For example, it is difficult to deal with multi-modal distribution for the conventional parametric approach.

With the constant increase of permeability for wind power, the flow distribution becomes more complex.  To reduce its potential threat to the power grid stability, it is necessary to study the influence of wind power generation location and permeability on cascading failure.\n  Here, a method based on node electric betweenness is proposed to study the influence of the change of permeability on the severity of the cascading failure when different nodes are selected as the location of wind generator.\n  Based on the calculation results of the scale of cascading failure, with the increase of permeability, load loss ratio r and connectivity capability k are also rising, suggesting that the increase of the permeability increases the severity of cascading failure.  Under the same permeability, the larger the electric betweenness the location node has, the smaller r and k are; otherwise, the smaller the electric betweenness is, the larger r and k are.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0038-88-01925","query":"wind power location","query_id":"681","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0038-88-01925___20","document_id":"clueweb22-en0038-88-01925","query_narrative":"Documents must provide the location of specific wind power\ninstallations.

With the increase of wind power penetration, the complexity of flow distribution is strengthened.  Therefore, it is necessary to study influences of site selection and permeability of wind power generation on cascading failure.  An analysis method based on electric betweenness of nodes was put forward, and influences of permeability change on cascading failure on different location selection for wind power generation were researched.  According to the study, it was found that when the electric betweenness was low, the overload of wind power led to declining uniformity of power flow distribution, resulting in transfer of flows to other lines.

Modern wind power plants consist of a mast, a nacelle with the mechanical equipment, and the rotor, normally with three rotor blades.  They start rotating at a wind speed of 2 metres per second (m\/s).  A wind power plant begins producing electricity from a wind speed of 4 m\/s. The maximum power output is reached at 12 to 15 m\/s. During storms, the wind turbine is usually switched off to prevent damage.  The tips of the rotor blades can reach speeds exceeding 200 km\/h. Electricity production depends on the wind speed (electricity production proportional to the third power of the wind speed).  If the wind speed is doubled, 23 or 8 times more energy is produced.\n  The technology of wind turbines is relatively mature.  However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of cost-effective design, production technology, overall efficiency and in operation and maintenance concepts, which result in lower production costs.

This movement powers the turbine that generates electricity\nAre there different kinds of wind turbines?\nWind turbines are differentiated by how they are mounted, this is usually pole-mounted or roof-mounted.  Roof-mounted turbines are installed directly onto the roof of your property or building.  They typically generate a power output between 0.5kW and 2kW. Pole-mounted wind turbines tend to be larger than roof-mounted counterparts.  They are freestanding units and can be easily positioned in the location with the strongest wind.  Pole-mounted wind turbines typically have a power output between 2kW and 6kW. Pole-mounted options have a greater power output than roof mounted turbines, but this is reflected in the higher cost at the outset\nWhat are the benefits of installing a wind turbine?\nWind turbines are ideal to power electrical devices at isolated locations that are not on the main grid.

And there are tens of thousands of different models of wind turbines.  When selecting a wind turbine for a site, one of the most important factors is the turbine power curve (TPC).  See example below:\nComparison of two different power curves (Wind-Turbine-Models.com)\nA turbine power curve shows the expected power output (kW or MW) for a range of given wind speeds.  It is possible to have two turbines with the same power rating but with different power curves.  This will likely result in a different annual energy production.  Therefore, when analysing a power curve, it is important to understand some key aspects of a power curve.  See the below sections for more information.\n  Cut-in Speed\nThis is the lowest wind speed which results in the turbine generating useful power.  A low cut in speed will result in the wind turbine utilising low speed wind speeds.\n  Rated Wind Speed\nThe wind speed which results in the turbine reaches is rated power.

The country’s obvious solar potential has also had the effect of putting other renewables in the shade.\n  That could be about to change as attention focuses on the wind potential offered by locations such as the power-hungry Northern Emirates and islands such as Sir Bani Yas, while at the same time technology to produce power from lower wind speeds improves.\n  Such technological developments are especially relevant for the UAE, which typically lacks the gales that drive the largest of existing wind farms in Europe and North America.\n  Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s eight-year-old renewable energy company, has taken a lead in investing in wind projects overseas.  After wind-mapping the country, it is also scouting possible locations for turbines at home.\n  The Mubadala Development unit has more than US$1 billion invested in energy projects around the world.

Among the places that look initially favourable is Sir Bani Yas Island, where Masdar has already presented plans to the Government for a 30MW project.\n  But finding the wind is only half of the problem.  The cost of erecting the turbines and their gigantic blades can be prohibitive without the right infrastructure.\n  To that extent, identifying commercially viable locations for wind power in the UAE is more challenging than doing the same for solar projects, where there are fewer variables to consider.\n  “The commercial viability of a wind project depends on the wind project itself, the specifics of the project and where it is located,” said Ahmed Al Awadi, the head of business support at Masdar’s clean energy unit.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0017-36-09203","query":"wind power location","query_id":"681","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0017-36-09203___2","document_id":"clueweb22-en0017-36-09203","query_narrative":"Documents must provide the location of specific wind power\ninstallations.

One sweep of such a rotor covers more than 18,600 square metres, or two-and-a-half football fields.\n  Another factor is the relatively weak wind speeds available throughout the UAE.  However, research and development into generating power at much lower velocities than was viable last decade has yielded positive results in the past five years.\n  “At first sight the country doesn’t look very windy, but there are locations where it makes sense to develop wind powers,” said Nicholas Fichaux, the programme officer for resource assessment at the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency.\n  But even in the absence of formal government-supported utility-scale wind farms, small private turbines are already operating in the country where grid power is lacking.\n  “You see quite a lot of turbines already on the road to Liwa,” said Mr Fichaux.

A location at the top of a windy hill or on the slope facing the prevailing wind will benefit most from the available wind.  A mast (tower) is usually necessary to achieve optimum results from your wind turbine.\n  Any site you choose should ideally elevate the wind turbine 30 feet above any wind-breaking obstacle within 30 feet.  To do this, it is likely you will need to mount your wind turbine atop a tower or mast.  Obstacles include tall trees, buildings, and rock outcrops.\n  When choosing your site, also consider the future growth of trees and any planned structures.  The best sites are upwind of any nearby obstacles, so the turbine is completely exposed to the prevailing wind.\n  When erecting a mast, there must be enough space to position the guy wires and to lower and raise the mast for essential maintenance.  Another consideration is the length of wire required between your wind turbine and your home.

{"id":74622,"text":"The changes in the use of the power lines can bring about power losses or benefits. Increasing wind power production can affect bottleneck situations.  Depending on its location, wind power may, at its best, reduce bottlenecks, but at another location result in more frequent bottlenecks.  There are a variety of means to maximize the use of existing transmission lines such as the use of online information, FACTS, and wind power-plant output control.  However, grid reinforcement may be necessary to maintain transmission adequacy and security.  Grid extensions are commonly needed if new generation is installed in weak grids far from load centers to make full use of the wind power.  The issue is generally the same for modern wind power plants or any other power plants.  The cost of grid reinforcements, due to wind power, is therefore very dependent on where the wind power plants are located relative to the load and grid infrastructure, and one must expect numbers to vary from country to country.  With current technology, wind power plants can be designed to meet industry expectations such as riding through voltage dips, supplying reactive power to the system, controlling terminal voltage, and participating in SCADA (supervision control and data acquisition) system operation with output and ramp rate control [  7, 8, 9 ].\n2.2.

{"id":74624,"text":"The capacity factor is affected by several parameters such as the variability of the wind at the site and the generator size. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electricity (and thus less profit) in high winds.  On the other hand, large generators would cost more but generate little extra power and may stall out at low wind speed.  Thus, the wind farm's optimum capacity factor aimed for would be around 20–35% [  6 ].\n  Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally.  However, wind is always in constant supply somewhere, making it a dependable source of energy because it will never expire or become extinct.  Annual variation also exists, but is not so significant.  Like other electricity sources, wind energy must be scheduled.  Wind power forecasting methods are used, but predictability of wind plant output remains low for short-term operation.  Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system.

Different locations will have different wind speed distributions.\n  Electricity generation\nTypical components of a wind turbine are gearbox, rotor shaft and brake assembly being lifted into position.\n  In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network.  At a substation, this medium voltage electrical current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.\n  A wind turbine is a rotating machine which converts the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy.
