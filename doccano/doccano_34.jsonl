There are various social networking sites roaming the internet out of which Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ are the most prominent and favorable ones as they provide a straightforward, easy platform for exchanging messages, pictures, videos, etc.  As of the third quarter of 2016, Facebook had 1.79 billion monthly active users, making it the world\u2019s most popular social networking site.

Do you agree or disagree?\nsample1\nToday\u2019s in a modern-driven world where human contact is so fast and quickly seems real because of ample advancement in technology.  Numerous social sites are becoming popular among youngsters.  However, these sites such as Facebook and instagram have significant adverse effects on both societies and people.  I agree with assertion because these sites are not only responsible for spreading false information of people but also developing an isolated community.\n  To begin with, unlike in the past time, these days society isolation seems a popular site because now individuals spend most of their time on social sites.  People, especially youngsters, are more likely to spend leisure time on Facebook, twitter than spending it with neighbors and friends.  This tendency indeed leads to social isolation, which is not helpful to develop trust and cooperation.

With the freedom social media sites give, individuals now have the power to raise their voice for or against issues/initiatives being taken in the city or on a global level.  Individuals are now empowered to give immediate feedback to actions taken by people in power and get to know live events as they happen.\n  Keeping these points in mind, there is a downside to usage of social media sites as well.  As it is known overuse of anything, will have an adverse effect on us.  In this era, the youth in particular, have around 15 hours screen time per day because of their excessive usage of social networking sites especially instagram.  This is unhealthy as constant usage of the device causes health hazards like spondylitis, eye power fluctuations and so on.  If the usage of social media can be restricted so that it doesn\u2019t affect the person\u2019s physical or social wellbeing, social networking sites can do wonders.\n  Overall, the positive impact of proper utilization of social networking sites on individuals and society, overweighs it\u2019s negative impact.\n  Do you have an essay on this topic?
