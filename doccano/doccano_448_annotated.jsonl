Unlike the other insurance policies it is not based on time.  The marine insurance policy expires when the ship arrives at its destination.  The policy only covers the subject matter or cargo, not the ship that carries it.\n  In Lloyd v. Fleming  [  1], Blackburn J gives the definition of marine insurance policy, according to him “marine insurance policy is a contract of indemnity against all the losses occurring to the cargo or the subject matter of  the policy from certain perils during the adventure.\n  Voyage policies are commonly used by exporters who need marine transport only occasionally or for relatively small amounts of subject matter.\n  The marine insurance policy only covers the risk which are unforeseen not the risk which can be prevented.

{"id":74460,"text":"The accidents are disrupting supply chains for retailers and manufacturers - from Amazon to Tesla.\n The rise in container losses may be driven by a combination of potential factors.  Larger ships, more extreme weather and a surge in freight rates and mis-declared cargo weights could all be at play, but there are also growing questions for how containers are secured on board ships.  Of six cases of container losses in the North Pacific between November 2020 and March 2021 analyzed by AGCS (One Apus, Maersk Essen, Maersk Eindhoven, Ever Liberal, Tianping and MSC Aries) there were a number of common factors, according to Chopra.\n  “All container losses occurred in rough seas and when the vessels were on a westerly heading during the voyage from Asia to the US.\n  The loss of containers could be the result of a combination of various factors like synchronous and parametric rolling.  But there may also be other issues at play, such as container stack collapse due to mis-declaration of cargo weights at a time when freight rates have been increasing,” says Chopra.\n  In 2018, the container ship CMA CGM G. Washington lost 137 containers overboard and a further 85 were damaged after the vessels unexpectedly pitched in heavy seas in the North Pacific while on passage from China to Los Angeles.

{"id":74462,"text":"In May 2021, the Singapore-registered container ship X-Press Pearl, which had been carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid, along with other chemicals and cosmetics, became the latest casualty when it caught fire and sank off Sri Lanka, resulting in the potential loss of almost 1,500 containers and the prospect of significant environmental pollution.\n The Cefor statistics found no reduction in large loss frequency for container vessels, despite a substantial reduction in claims frequency and cost for hull claims overall in 2020.  Container ship fires were especially prevalent, with a notable increase in the frequency of fires costing over $500,000.\n  Vessel size has a direct correlation to the potential size of loss.  Car transporters\/RoRo and large container vessels are at higher risk of fire with the potential for greater consequences should a fire break out, according to Cefor analysis.  The larger the number of containers on board, the higher the probability that at least one could ignite and cause a fire, and the harder it is to contain and extinguish the fire.\n  Container ship fires often start in containers, which can be the result of non-declaration or mis-declaration of hazardous cargo, such as self-igniting charcoal, chemicals and batteries.

{"id":74470,"text":"The losses in case of marine insurance are divided into two categories, as presented below:\nKey Differences Between Fire Insurance and Marine Insurance\nThe difference between fire insurance and marine insurance are discussed in the points given below:\nFire insurance can be defined as a contract in which the insurance company promises to indemnify the insured, in case of any loss or damage caused to the property covered in the contract, of the insured, due to fire. On the other hand, by the term ‘marine insurance’, we mean an insurance in which the insurance company undertakes to compensate the insured in case of any loss to the ship or cargo, because of sea danger.\n  In fire insurance, the insurable interest must be present both at the time of taking policy and when the loss occurs.  As against, in case of marine insurance, the insurable interest must be there only at the time of loss.\n  Fire insurance covers risks due to fire and associated risks.  Conversely, marine insurance covers sea perils.\n  The claim in case of fire insurance is the amount insured, or the actual loss sustained whichever is less.  In contrast, the compensation would be the cost of the goods plus a reasonable margin, i.e. 10-15% for anticipated profits.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0027-35-09650","query":"ship losses","query_id":"448","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0027-35-09650___5","document_id":"clueweb22-en0027-35-09650","query_narrative":"Any ship loss due to weather is relevant, either in international\nor coastal waters.","query_description":"Identify instances in which weather was a main or contributing\nfactor in the loss of a ship at sea.","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}

It is prone to risks that occur due to act of God, fire, enemies, etc.\n  Hull insurance: When the ship is prone to risks that arise out of an act of God, fire, enemies, etc. then the shipowner can take hull insurance, to cover these risks.\n  Freight insurance: Freight insurance is taken when the owner of goods commits to pay the freight charges if the cargo is delivered to the port in a safe manner, and it destroys on the way.

{"id":74475,"text":"As explained in Rule 34 cover is available for a claimant’s consequential losses as a result of cargo damage, but if the claimant is not ultimately legally responsible for freight, demurrage or hire in respect of the Member’s Ship that is not a consequential loss on cargo, it is more properly the Member’s loss in the earnings of the Ship. Therefore, even if freight, demurrage or hire is strictly payable in the first instance by the claimant in accordance with the terms of the contract (e.g. a delay in discharge arises from damaged cargo but does not trigger an off-hire clause or stop laytime, which will often be the case), but the claimant is able to claim these back as damages as a consequence of owner’s breach of the contract, e.g. unseaworthiness, the loss of earnings lies ultimately with the owners.  The same applies where the owner seeks to claim freight, demurrage or hire which has not been paid and there is a cross claim for damages in an equal amount giving rise to a defence of ‘circuity of action’.

{"id":74481,"text":"Marine Cargo Insurance: Cargo insurance or marine cargo insurance covers and protects the cargo when the ship is actually sailing in the oceanic waters. This type of insurance is mainly beneficial for oil tankers and other heavy cargo-carrying ships.  In technical terms, cargo insurance covers losses that occur while the ship is in transit.\n  There are many companies across the world which provide for marine insurance and cargo marine insurance policies.  Depending on the client’s convenience and necessity the right marine insurance policy can be recommended by the insurance company and then chosen by the client.\n  Some of the companies that offer marine insurance policies (including cargo insurance) include the Saucon Mutual Insurance Company, established in the year 1832 and the Insurance Network of America, established in the year 1949.\n  However, there are a lot of minor points that a client needs to consider while going for a marine insurance policy.  If these points are ignored, then the client could lose money as compensation even after paying proper premium amounts.\n  If the goods are not packed properly or if the goods that are shipped are second hand then the cargo insurance policy will not be applicable.

{"id":74482,"text":"Similarly, if the loss to the cargo is due to the negligence of the ship workers or if the workers on the ship are dishonest, then the marine cargo policy will not be applicable. Even weather conditions influence whether a marine insurance policy will be covered or not.\n  A marine insurance policy also depends to a large extent on the size of the ship.  Another important thing to be considered while going for cargo insurance is whether to opt for an insurance policy that will be covered as per the voyages taken by the ship or as per a pre-defined time schedule decided by the ship owner.\n  Thus it can be concluded that taking out marine cargo insurance does not only depend on the client but also on other factors as well.

In the absence of marine insurance, ship owners could incur not just loss to their ships but could also face financial losses in case if the ship is commercially used as cargo-carriers.\n  This is why, in order to specifically ensure the protection of the cargo that is carried, there is the concept of cargo insurance or marine cargo insurance.  The difference between marine insurance and the marine cargo insurance can be explained below:\nMarine Insurance: Marine insurance policies are based on the Marine Insurance Act, 1906.  While marine insurance is deep in its coverage of possible losses, it does not cover losses that happen while the ship is sailing in the waters.  This becomes a problem in case of those water areas where the risk of loss is magnified because of piracy and other reasons.  In order to overcome this problem, the concept of marine cargo insurance emerged.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0046-75-04103","query":"ship losses","query_id":"448","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0046-75-04103___1","document_id":"clueweb22-en0046-75-04103","query_narrative":"Any ship loss due to weather is relevant, either in international\nor coastal waters.","query_description":"Identify instances in which weather was a main or contributing\nfactor in the loss of a ship at sea.","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":74485,"text":"When the insured has been compensated the title of goods passes on to the insurer. If some amount is received from the sale of damaged goods, the amount will go to the insurer and not to the insured.\n2. Constructive Total Loss:\nThis occurs when the ship is abandoned for certain reasons.  It is not commercially viable to retrieve the ship or cargo.  The ship or the cargo is not wholly destroyed but it is not practicable to get it repaired and restore it to its original position.  When a ship is badly damaged, and the cost of repairs is expected to be more than the value of the ship, it will be advisable to abandon the ship.\n  In the same way if the cargo is safe in the abandoned ship but the cost of bringing the cargo to the coast is more than the cost of cargo, then it will be proper to leave the cargo.  In the case of constructive total loss, the insured gives a notice of abandonment and surrenders its interest in the subject-matter to the insurer.  The insured can claim damage for total loss.\n  B.

General Average Loss:\nA general average loss is caused voluntarily to avoid an impending danger.  “A general average loss is one which is caused by an extra-ordinary sacrifice or expenditure voluntarily and reasonably made or incurred under fortuitous circumstances, for the sole purpose of preserving the common interest from an impending peril.”\nIf a ship is sinking because of overload, some of the cargo may be thrown out of the ship with a purpose to save the ship and the crew.  It will be a case of general average loss.\n  ADVERTISEMENTS:\nSome conditions are to be satisfied before deciding about a general average loss:\n(a)  There must be an extra-ordinary situation.\n  (b)  The peril must be real and not imaginary.\n  (c)  The loss must be voluntary and deliberate.\n  ADVERTISEMENTS:\n(d)  The sacrifice must be made prudently.\n ","url":"https:\/\/chatnoir-webcontent.web.webis.de\/?index=cw22&trec-id=clueweb22-en0011-38-14863","query":"ship losses","query_id":"448","passage_id":"clueweb22-en0011-38-14863___3","document_id":"clueweb22-en0011-38-14863","query_narrative":"Any ship loss due to weather is relevant, either in international\nor coastal waters.","query_description":"Identify instances in which weather was a main or contributing\nfactor in the loss of a ship at sea.","label":["Not Relevant (0)"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":74487,"text":"All lost lives are associated with patrol vessels owned by the government of Sri Lanka.\n Fig.   5 shows the ship losses per accident category.  Most ship losses are associated with general cargo\/multipurpose ships and fishing vessels.  A total of 1724 ships have been lost in the period 2000–2018.\n  Fig.   5 shows some similarities with Fig. 4.  Most ships that were lost are general cargo\/multipurpose ships and fishing ships.  It is noteworthy that general cargo\/multipurpose ships sink more often than other cargo ships.  The probability that a ship is lost due to an accident is twice as high for general cargo\/multipurpose ships as for other cargo ships.  Regarding fishing ships, 25% of the shipping accidents resulted in a ship loss, the highest probability of all ship types.\n  Furthermore, it appears that fire\/explosion and stranded accidents cause significantly more ship losses for fishing ships compared to other ship types.  Container ships, on the other hand, have a better track record of surviving a fire\/explosion accident compared to other ship types.\n3.3.

{"id":74488,"text":"This difference is mostly explained by a low number of collision accidents. This might be explained by the fact that fishing ships spent more time in less crowded fishing areas and less time in busy traffic lanes, where the probability of a collision is higher.\n  Fig. 10 shows the number of ship losses due to navigation-related accidents.  The total number of ship losses due to navigation-related accidents between 2000 and 2018 is 513, which is only 30% of all ship losses.  This implies that navigation-related accidents are on average less severe than other casualty types in terms of damage to the ship.  As can be seen, the number of ship losses rapidly decreases for ships with a length above 120 m. This can at least in part be attributed to IMO's damage stability regulations.  The required subdivision index that is used in the SOLAS regulations is dependent on the length of the ship: as ships get longer, the index rises, thus requiring the ship to stay afloat in a larger number of damage scenarios.\n  Download : Download high-res image (401KB)\nDownload : Download full-size image\nFig. 10.

{"id":74506,"text":"For example:\nShip A collides with ship B and ship A is held 100 per cent to blame for the collision. Ship B suffers losses of USD 15 million which is less than the sum to which ship A can limit its liability.  Consequently, ship A is liable to pay ship B its full claim of USD 15 million.  However, the hull and machinery (H&M) policy of ship A is subject to the Nordic Plan 2013 which includes standard 4\/4ths collision liability cover with an insured value of USD 12 million.  Therefore, since the cover for collision liability under the H&M policy for ship A is limited to USD 12 million, i.e. the sum insured, ship A’s liability to pay the balance of USD 3 million is not covered by the H&M policy with the result that cover for that balance is available under Rule 36.\n  The cover for collision liability is usually additional to the cover for loss of, or damage to, the insured ship.  Therefore, the hull insurers may be liable for double the sum insured if the insured ship becomes an actual or constructive total loss as a result of the collision and the liability of that ship to the other ship(s) equals or exceeds the sum insured.

{"id":74507,"text":"6 If the vessel is bareboat or demise chartered, any liability is likely to rest with the bareboat (demise) charterer rather than the registered owner of the Ship, since the bareboat charterer is responsible for operation of the Ship, including navigation.\n 7 The Convention determines that each shipowner shall bear his own loss in circumstances where neither ship is considered to be at fault for the collision, e.g. two ships collide as a result of breaking their moorings or dragging their anchors following a sudden, unexpected and irresistible natural phenomenon such as a tsunami.  The same principle applies in circumstances where it is impossible to establish who is to blame, e.g. two ships colliding in open sea with the loss of all hands and with no other witnesses or information.\n8 Under US law the owners of both ships are also jointly and severally liable in respect of damage to property, including damage to cargo on each ship.  In order to avoid certain difficulties which arise in such circumstances the Association has recommended that, even though this clause is probably not enforceable in the US in relation to public contracts of carriage, the ‘Both to Blame Collision Clause’ is included in Bills of Lading and charterparties and a failure so to do may prejudice cover.

To ram the point home, other wording said that the shipyard was not liable for any ‘consequential or special losses’ etc.\n  The court refused to interpret that phrase in the Hadley v Baxendale way – to mean that the only losses excluded from the shipyard’s liability were those relating to matters both parties should have had in mind in the special circumstances of this particular ship construction.
